    B -->|2| C[BigQuery Raw Tables]
    C -->|3| D[load_data_and_calculate.py]

    I -->|8| J[opt_in_decision_analysis_v3]
    I -->|8| K[opt_in_recommendations_v3]
```

### Script Execution Order:
1. **Data Loading Phase:**
   - `load_excel_consumption_data.py` - Loads Excel files to BigQuery
   - `load_data_and_calculate.py` - Processes and calculates metrics

2. **Analysis Phase:**
   - `create_opt_in_decision_model.py` - Creates initial opt-in analysis
   - `create_penalty_analysis_corrected.py` - Calculates penalties
   - `check_penalty_math.py` - Validates calculations

3. **Correction Phase:**
   - `fix_42_cap_and_yearwise_exemptions.py` - Applies 42% cap and handles exemptions
   - Creates v3 views/tables with corrections

4. **Validation Phase:**
   - `check_consumption_schema.py` - Validates data schemas
   - Run diagnostic queries to verify results

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### 1. **42% Maximum Reduction Cap Confirmation**

**Yes, the 42% cap is correctly implemented.** From the technical documentation:

- No building must reduce more than 42% from baseline EUI
- Formula: `Final Target ‚â• Baseline √ó (1 - 0.42)`
- Example: If baseline = 1000, minimum target = 580

The code correctly implements this in the BigQuery views with proper MAI floor considerations.

### 2. **Opt-In Decision Logic**

The model evaluates multiple factors:

```python
# Decision hierarchy:
1. Always opt-in if:
   - Cannot meet ANY targets (2025, 2027, 2030)
   - Required reduction > 40% (approaching 42% cap)
   - Cash flow constrained + large early penalties
   - Technical difficulty score ‚â• 80

2. Never opt-in if:
   - Already meets 2025 target
   - Required reduction < 10%
   - NPV shows opt-in costs >$100k more

3. Financial analysis for others:
   - Compare NPV of both paths
   - Account for 7% discount rate
   - Consider time value of money
```

### 3. **MAI (Manufacturing/Agricultural/Industrial) Special Rules**

- Minimum floor: 52.9 kBtu/sqft
- Applied AFTER 42% cap calculation
- Takes whichever is less stringent (higher target)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### Data Quality:
- Some buildings have incomplete consumption data
- Weather normalization assumptions may need refinement
- Property type classifications require periodic review

### Policy Interpretation:
- 42% cap is assumed but should be confirmed with city
- MAI floor of 52.9 may have exceptions
- Penalty rates could change with policy updates

### Technical Debt:
- Need to implement proper error handling in GCP scripts
- Should add unit tests for critical calculations
- Consider implementing data versioning

## üìä Updates Since Initial Handoff

### July 7, 2025 Update (Completed 5:30 PM MST):

#### Issues Discovered:
1. **100% Reduction Requirements**: Some buildings showed unrealistic 100% reduction requirements
2. **Exempt Building Handling**: Hospitals and government buildings were incorrectly assumed to be exempt
3. **Year-Specific Exemptions**: Exempt status was only used through 2020, not current years

#### Solutions Implemented:
1. **Created `fix_42_cap_and_yearwise_exemptions.py`**:
   - Properly applies 42% maximum reduction cap to all targets
   - Only excludes building data for specific years marked "Exempt"
   - Uses latest valid (non-exempt) year data for analysis
   - Creates `opt_in_decision_analysis_v3` view

2. **Key Findings**:
   - Exempt buildings were primarily marked in 2020 or earlier
   - No hospitals are automatically exempt (must check Status column)
   - 42% cap prevents unrealistic reduction requirements
   - 560 buildings (18.7%) now benefit from the 42% cap
   - No buildings currently show as exempt in latest data years

3. **New BigQuery Objects Created**:
   - `opt_in_decision_analysis_v3` - Corrected analysis view
   - `opt_in_recommendations_v3` - Updated recommendations table
   - Both properly handle caps and year-specific exemptions

#### Validation Results (Confirmed):
- ‚úÖ Maximum reduction: 42.0% (PASS)
- ‚úÖ Buildings over 42%: 0 (PASS)
- ‚úÖ Buildings at cap: 560
- ‚úÖ Total buildings: 3,004
- ‚úÖ Opt-in recommendations: 1,425 (47.5%)
- ‚úÖ Total penalties: $3.54B
- ‚úÖ Opt-in savings: $457.1M
- ‚úÖ Latest data year: 2024
- ‚úÖ Currently exempt: 0

#### Technical Difficulty Score (Revised):
| Score | Required Reduction | Category | Impact |
|-------|--------------------|----------|---------|
| 100   | ‚â•40% (at/near cap) | At maximum | Always opt-in |
| 90    | >35%               | Approaching cap | Usually opt-in |
| 70    | >30%               | Very difficult | Consider opt-in |
| 50    | >20%               | Difficult | Financial analysis |
| 30    | >10%               | Moderate | Financial analysis |
| 10    | ‚â§10%               | Achievable | Rarely opt-in |
