## 📝 Summary of This Session

### Session Context
Started from handoff `claude_handoff_20250714_1609.md` which documented:
- Integration test suite creation (87.5% passing)
- BigQuery schema investigation tools
- Identified column name mismatches blocking view regeneration

### Session Objectives
1. ✅ Complete BigQuery schema investigation and fix issues

## 📋 Important Session Guidelines for All Future Work

These guidelines are designed to maximize project memory retention, ensure high-quality handoffs, and maintain clarity across coding sessions.

### ✅ 1. Code Development Process
- **Always** summarize the next coding steps and reasoning before writing or modifying code.
- Ask for agreement before proceeding with code changes.
- Clearly explain the impact of any proposed change on project scope, logic, or output.

### ✅ 2. Handoff Generation Requirements
- **Always** generate a new handoff after:
  - New code is generated or major modifications are made.
  - The project direction changes significantly.
  - New development ideas are discussed and accepted.
- Format: `claude_handoff_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md`
- Save to: `/Users/robertpadgett/Projects/01_My_Notebooks/500_ED_Risk_Retro_BP/docs/handoffs`
- At the top of the handoff, reference the previous handoff file and session ID (if used).

### ✅ 3. Persistent Session State Management
- Maintain a `session_state.md` or `project_log.md` file to track:
  - Session start/end timestamps
  - Key decisions, issues raised, and open questions
  - Links to modified or created files
- Prompt: "Should this update be added to persistent memory?"

### ✅ 4. File System Integration
- Use File System Integration (as authorized) to save outputs directly to the local machine.
- If artifacts are required instead:
  - Add a comment at the top with the suggested file name
  - Include the save location and purpose of the file

### ✅ 5. Code Documentation Standards
- Include docstrings for all new functions
- Maintain `README.md` and update if tools, methods, or assumptions change
- Reference the most recent handoff when documenting fixes or changes

### ✅ 6. Visual & Structural Cues
- Use consistent emoji markers in handoffs:
  - `🛠️` for bug fixes
  - `🚧` for in-progress work
  - `✅` for completed tasks
  - `❓` for open questions
  - `📎` for linked resources
- Add a 📂 File Index listing modified/created files and their locations

### ✅ 7. Testing and Validation
- Always test new or changed code before marking tasks complete
- Document test results clearly, including edge cases and limitations
- Maintain a `🧪 Test Registry` linking tests to scripts and modules

### ✅ 8. Claude Session Modes
- At start of session, declare Claude Mode:
  - `Autonomous` – Acting without prompting
  - `Interactive` – Guided by user, with approval checks
  - `Passive` – Summarizing/logging only
- Ask: "What would make this session a success?" at session start

### ✅ 9. Error Handling
- Log all errors encountered and how they were resolved
- Note any workarounds or technical constraints
- Flag any unresolved or postponed issues

### ✅ 10. Project Memory and Scope
- Use handoffs to build persistent memory of progress and decisions
- Confirm any scope changes and log them in a `project_scope.md` or similar
- Maintain audit trail of design assumptions and module boundaries

### ✅ 11. Daily Summary (Optional)
- Generate a `daily_summary_YYYYMMDD.md` if multiple sessions occur in a day
- Roll up key updates, major shifts in logic, and summary of tests run

### ✅ 12. These Guidelines Apply to ALL Future Sessions
- Include these in every future handoff until otherwise updated.
- Review periodically to refine based on workflow and tool changes
