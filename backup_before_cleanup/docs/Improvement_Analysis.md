# Analysis: Why Are So Many Buildings Improving from Baseline?

## üìä Key Finding
A surprisingly high percentage of buildings show improvement from their baseline year. This is actually **good news** for Denver's climate goals!

## üîç Likely Reasons for Widespread Improvement

### 1. **COVID-19 Impact Recovery**
- Many buildings had artificially low occupancy in 2020-2021
- As occupancy returned to normal, building operators optimized operations
- "Return to office" included modernized HVAC and controls

### 2. **Energize Denver Program Effect**
- Program launched in 2019 with clear targets
- Building owners had 4-5 years to prepare for penalties
- Proactive investments in efficiency to avoid future fines

### 3. **Energy Price Signals**
- Rising natural gas and electricity costs (2021-2023)
- Strong financial incentive to reduce consumption
- Quick payback on efficiency investments

### 4. **Technology Improvements**
- LED lighting retrofits (30-50% electricity savings)
- Smart building controls and IoT sensors
- More efficient HVAC equipment replacements

### 5. **Federal and Local Incentives**
- IRA tax credits (30%+ for qualifying improvements)
- Xcel Energy rebates for efficiency upgrades
- Colorado C-PACE financing availability

### 6. **Baseline Year Selection**
- Most buildings use 2019 as baseline (pre-COVID)
- 2019 was a "normal" operations year
- Improvements since then reflect genuine efficiency gains

## üìà Improvement Distribution by Baseline Year

Based on the data patterns:
- **2019 baseline buildings**: Highest improvement rates (most common baseline)
- **2020-2021 baseline buildings**: May show less improvement (COVID-affected baselines)
- **2022 baseline buildings**: Newer buildings or recent major renovations

## ‚úÖ What This Means

1. **Policy Success**: Energize Denver is driving real change
2. **Market Response**: Building owners are taking action before penalties
3. **Technology Adoption**: Efficiency improvements are accessible and cost-effective
4. **Future Outlook**: Continued improvement likely as targets tighten

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats

- Some buildings may have changed use types (affecting EUI)
- Weather normalization helps but isn't perfect
- Data quality has improved over time
- Some "improvement" may be from better data reporting

## üéØ Implications for Your Project

1. **Retrofit Opportunities**: Focus on buildings NOT improving (higher impact)
2. **Success Stories**: Document what worked for improving buildings
3. **Cluster Benefits**: Group lagging buildings with successful ones
4. **Investment Priority**: Target buildings far from their targets

The high improvement rate validates the thermal energy service business model - building owners ARE willing to invest when the business case is clear!
