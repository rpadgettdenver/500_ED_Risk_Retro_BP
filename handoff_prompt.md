# DER Clustering Analysis - Project Handoff (Enhanced Update)

## ðŸŽ¯ What We've Successfully Accomplished

### 1. **Comprehensive Data Loading - COMPLETE âœ…**
- Successfully loaded 21,437 rows from Excel file (multiple years)
- Identified 3,320 unique buildings across years 2016-2024
- **Version 1**: Used 2023 as base year: 2,932 buildings with complete data
- **Version 2 (NEW)**: Enhanced loader for ALL buildings reporting after 2021
- Merged with geocoding: 2,915 buildings have coordinates (99.4%)
- Integrated EPB status: 304 EPB buildings identified
- Added zip codes for geographic analysis

### 2. **Enhanced Data Loader Created**
New script `enhanced_comprehensive_loader.py` that:
- **Timestamps all outputs** (format: YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS)
- **Includes ALL buildings that reported after 2021** (post-COVID recovery)
- **Uses most recent data** for each building regardless of year
- **Tracks reporting history** (when each building last reported)
- **Maximizes coverage** while using best available data
- Creates both timestamped and "latest" versions for easy reference

### 3. **Data Quality Achievements**
- All energy columns loaded including:
  - Weather Normalized Site EUI (for penalties)
  - Electricity Use (kWh)
  - Natural Gas Use (kBtu)
  - Total GHG Emissions (mtCO2e)
- Calculated 3-year EUI trends
- **NEW: Baseline year trends** - Shows improvement from each building's baseline year (2019 for most)
- **NEW: Float formatting** - All numeric columns formatted as float64 for Excel compatibility
- Building names and addresses preserved
- Clean, analysis-ready datasets created

### 4. **Output Files Created**
Located in `/data/processed/`:

**Version 1 (2023 only)**:
- `energize_denver_2023_comprehensive.csv` - 2023 data only
- `energize_denver_comprehensive.csv` - Copy for reference
- `energize_denver_all_years.csv` - Historical data

**Version 2 (Post-2021 Enhanced)** - TO BE RUN:
- `energize_denver_comprehensive_[timestamp].csv` - All post-2021 buildings
- `energize_denver_comprehensive_latest.csv` - Latest reference
- `energize_denver_all_years_[timestamp].csv` - Historical with timestamp
- `comprehensive_data_summary_[timestamp].json` - Metadata
- `comprehensive_data_summary_latest.json` - Latest metadata

### 5. **Scripts Developed**
Working scripts:
- `comprehensive_energy_loader.py` - âœ… Base version (2023 focus)
- `enhanced_comprehensive_loader.py` - âœ… UPDATED with:
  - Baseline year trends from Building_EUI_Targets.csv
  - Float formatting for Excel compatibility (Average_EUI_Recent, EUI_Trend_Pct, latitude)
  - Calculates energy trends from each building's specific baseline year
  - Shows which baseline years have improving buildings
- `der_clustering_analysis.py` - Core clustering algorithm
- `integrate_epb_data.py` - EPB integration
- `fixed_enhanced_der_clustering.py` - Has building details logic

## ðŸ“‹ Immediate Next Steps

### 1. **Run Enhanced Loader**
```bash
cd /Users/robertpadgett/Projects/01_My_Notebooks/500_ED_Risk_Retro_BP/src/data_processing
python enhanced_comprehensive_loader.py
```
This will create timestamped datasets with ALL buildings reporting after 2021

### 2. **Create Final DER Clustering Script**
Need to create a script that:
- Uses `energize_denver_comprehensive_latest.csv`
- Handles varying years (Most_Recent_Report_Year column)
- Calculates thermal loads from actual energy data
- Properly handles all column names from the new dataset
- Outputs timestamped results

### 3. **Expected Dataset Improvements**
Post-2021 filter should give us:
- ~3,000+ buildings (vs 2,932 from 2023 only)
- Mix of 2022, 2023, and 2024 data
- Better coverage of active buildings
- Avoids COVID-impacted data

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Key Columns in Enhanced Dataset:
```
Building ID, Building Name, Master Property Type,
Site Energy Use, Site EUI, 
Weather Normalized Site Energy Use, Weather Normalized Site EUI,
Electricity Use Grid Purchase (kWh), Natural Gas Use (kBtu),
Total GHG Emissions (mtCO2e), 
latitude, longitude, zip_code, is_epb,
Most_Recent_Report_Year, Years_Reported, Number_Years_Reported,
Average_EUI_Recent, EUI_Trend_Pct
```

### Thermal Calculations:
```python
# Heating load (MMBtu) from gas
heating_mmbtu = row['Natural Gas Use (kBtu)'] / 1000

# Cooling load (tons) from electricity
cooling_tons = row['Electricity Use Grid Purchase (kWh)'] * 0.3 / (12 * 2000)
```

## ðŸ’¡ Benefits of Enhanced Approach

1. **Timestamps**: Track analysis versions and data freshness
2. **Maximum Coverage**: Capture all active buildings post-COVID
3. **Flexibility**: Each building uses its most recent data
4. **Trend Tracking**: Know when buildings last reported
5. **Easy Updates**: Just reference "latest" files

## ðŸš€ Ready to Proceed

Next session should:
1. Run `enhanced_comprehensive_loader.py`
2. Verify increased building count
3. Create final timestamped DER clustering analysis
4. Generate stakeholder reports with clear data provenance

The enhanced data foundation ensures maximum building coverage with best available data!
