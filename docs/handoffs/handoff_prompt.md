# TES+HP Energy-as-a-Service Business Model - Project Handoff (Major Update)

## 🎯 Current Project Status

### Project Overview
Developing a **Thermal Energy Storage (TES) + Heat Pump Energy-as-a-Service** business model for multifamily and commercial buildings in Denver subject to Energize Denver Building Performance Standards. This session has created a complete analysis framework with unified configuration management.

**Project Location:** `/Users/robertpadgett/Projects/01_My_Notebooks/500_ED_Risk_Retro_BP/`

## 🏗️ What We've Built in This Session

### 1. **Unified Configuration System** ✅
Created `src/config/project_config.py` that provides:
- **Single source of truth** for all project assumptions
- **Easy modification** of any parameter in one place
- **Automatic calculation** of derived values
- **Save/load configurations** to JSON for scenario management
- **Print assumptions table** showing all parameters with their locations

Key features:
```python
from config import get_config, update_config
config = get_config()
config.print_assumptions_table()  # Shows all assumptions
update_config({'systems': {'4pipe_wshp_tes': {'equipment_cost_base': 1000000}}})
```

### 2. **Complete Analysis Modules** ✅

#### a) **HVAC System Impact Modeler** (`src/models/hvac_system_impact_modeler.py`)
- Models EUI impact of different HVAC systems
- Calculates compliance with ED targets
- Includes electrification bonus (10% higher EUI allowed)
- Estimates installation costs and penalty avoidance

#### b) **Cash Flow Bridge Analysis** (`src/models/tes_hp_cash_flow_bridge.py`)
- Month-by-month cash flows from pre-construction through operations
- Bridge loan sizing and timing
- Incentive receipt scheduling
- Developer returns calculation

#### c) **Integrated Analyzer** (`src/analysis/integrated_tes_hp_analyzer.py`)
- Combines all analyses into executive summaries
- Generates presentation-ready charts
- Creates JSON reports for further analysis
- Now uses unified configuration

#### d) **Bridge Loan Package Generator** (`src/models/bridge_loan_investor_package.py`)
- Creates professional PDF investor packages
- Includes coverage ratios and security analysis
- Generates term sheets
- Shows repayment waterfalls

### 3. **Key Financial Findings for Building 2952** ✅

Using realistic assumptions ($1.2M equipment + $200k TES):
- **Total Project Cost**: $2.4M
- **Total Incentives**: $1.4M (58% coverage)
  - Federal ITC (40%): $728k
  - Depreciation: $403k
  - DRCOG Grant: $260k
  - Xcel Rebate: $182k
- **Net Project Cost**: $996k
- **Developer ROE**: 316% on $200k equity
- **Building Benefits**:
  - Avoids $270k equipment replacement
  - 70% EUI reduction (fully compliant through 2030)
  - No upfront costs
  - Monthly fee less than current energy costs

### 4. **Analysis Scripts Created** ✅

- `run_unified_analysis.py` - Main analysis using unified config
- `src/test_unified_config.py` - Tests and demonstrates configuration system
- Multiple scenario analysis capabilities built in

## 🚀 Next Steps for Development

### 1. **System Type Validation & Enhancement**
Need to expand beyond 4-pipe WSHP+TES to include:
- **Air-Source Heat Pumps (ASHP)** with ducted/ductless options
- **Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF)** systems
- **Ground-Source Heat Pumps (GSHP)** where applicable
- **Hybrid systems** (gas backup for extreme cold)
- **Heat recovery chillers** for simultaneous heating/cooling

Each system needs:
- Accurate cost/sqft estimates
- Performance curves for Denver climate
- Maintenance cost profiles
- Expected lifetime and replacement cycles

### 2. **Xcel Energy Rebate Verification** 🔴 CRITICAL
Current analysis assumes $3,500/unit for Clean Heat Plan. Need to:

#### a) **Prescriptive Rebates**
- Verify current prescriptive rebate amounts
- Map our systems to Xcel's equipment categories
- Account for efficiency tier requirements
- Consider electric panel upgrade rebates

#### b) **Custom Rebates**
Many of our innovative systems won't fit prescriptive categories:
- TES systems likely need custom rebate application
- 4-pipe WSHP may exceed prescriptive efficiency levels
- Need to model $/kWh and $/kW savings
- Measurement & Verification (M&V) requirements

#### c) **Strategic Stacking**
- Prescriptive for standard equipment
- Custom for innovative components
- Demand response incentives for TES
- Time-of-use optimization revenue

### 3. **GHG Emissions Calculations** 🌍
Essential for maximizing DRCOG and accessing Colorado Air & Space Resources (CASR) funding:

#### a) **20-Year GHG Model Needed**
```python
class GHGCalculator:
    def calculate_20yr_ghg_reduction(self, baseline_system, new_system):
        # Account for:
        # - Grid decarbonization trajectory (Xcel 80% by 2030)
        # - Refrigerant leakage rates
        # - Equipment degradation over time
        # - Embodied carbon of equipment
        return mtco2e_reduced
```

#### b) **Key Metrics to Calculate**
- Lifetime GHG reduction (mtCO2e)
- Cost per ton of CO2 avoided
- Social cost of carbon benefits
- Environmental justice metrics for EPB buildings

### 4. **DRCOG CPRG Funding Optimization**
Current assumption: $5k/unit for EPB buildings. Need to:
- Model GHG reduction requirements
- Optimize system design for $/ton CO2
- Prepare compelling equity narratives
- Track workforce development opportunities

### 5. **AI Agent Integration Requirements** 🤖

#### a) **Scenario Optimization Agent**
```python
class TESHPOptimizationAgent:
    """Optimizes system design and financial structure"""
    
    def optimize_system_selection(self, building_profile):
        # Test all system types
        # Consider climate zones
        # Optimize for NPV, GHG, or incentive coverage
        
    def maximize_incentive_stack(self, project_params):
        # Test different equipment combinations
        # Optimize timing of installations
        # Maximize total incentive capture
        
    def monte_carlo_analysis(self, uncertainty_params):
        # Run 1000+ scenarios
        # Vary costs, energy prices, incentive availability
        # Generate risk-adjusted returns
```

#### b) **Market Intelligence Agent**
- Scrape Xcel rebate updates
- Track DRCOG funding rounds
- Monitor equipment costs
- Analyze competitor projects

#### c) **Portfolio Analysis Agent**
- Identify highest-impact buildings
- Optimize deployment sequence
- Manage capital allocation
- Track performance metrics

### 6. **Data Enhancements Needed**

#### a) **Building-Specific**
- Historical energy bills (hourly if available)
- Equipment age and condition
- Tenant comfort complaints
- Electrical infrastructure capacity

#### b) **Market Data**
- Recent project costs in Denver
- Contractor availability
- Equipment lead times
- Utility interconnection timelines

### 7. **Regulatory Tracking**
- Energize Denver policy updates
- Federal ITC guidance changes
- State/local incentive programs
- Building electrification mandates

## 💡 Key Insights to Preserve

1. **Financial Model is Sound**: With realistic costs ($2.4M total), the economics work due to 58% incentive coverage
2. **70% EUI Reduction is Achievable**: 4-pipe WSHP+TES can deliver dramatic efficiency gains
3. **Developer Returns are Attractive**: 300%+ ROE makes this investable
4. **Building Owners Win**: No upfront cost + lower monthly bills + compliance
5. **Timing is Critical**: ITC at 40% through 2032, but DRCOG funds are limited

## 🛠️ Technical Notes

- All monetary values assume 2025 dollars with 30% escalation already applied
- EUI calculations use Weather Normalized Site EUI from Energize Denver
- Penalty calculations follow official ED guidance ($0.30/$0.50/$0.70 per sqft per kBtu over)
- Bridge loan assumes 12% interest, 12-month term
- All depreciation assumes 80% bonus depreciation × 35% tax rate

The foundation is solid. Next steps focus on verification, expansion, and automation!
