# Claude Handoff - July 14, 2025 - 8:00 AM MST

## 🚀 Session Summary
Continued development of Energize Denver Risk & Retrofit Strategy Platform, focusing on implementing core utility modules for penalty calculation, year normalization, opt-in prediction, and portfolio risk analysis.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Fixed Penalty Rates** ✅
- Updated `integrated_tes_hp_analyzer.py` to use centralized penalty calculator
- Removed hardcoded rates that were incorrectly set to $0.15 (should vary by path)
- Now imports and uses `EnergizeDenverPenaltyCalculator` for consistent penalty calculations
- Penalty calculator correctly implements:
  - Standard Path: $0.15/kBtu over target
  - ACO Path: $0.23/kBtu over target (NOT $0.30 or $0.70 as in old BigQuery scripts)

### 2. **Created Year Normalization Module** ✅
**File:** `/src/utils/year_normalization.py`
- Maps actual years to normalized analysis years
- Configurable base year (default 2024)
- Supports absolute and differential time series
- Includes reverse mapping functionality
- Ready for aggregate portfolio analysis

### 3. **Created Opt-In Predictor Module** ✅
**File:** `/src/utils/opt_in_predictor.py`
- Ported BigQuery opt-in logic to Python
- Uses correct penalty rates: $0.15 (standard) and $0.23 (ACO)
- Decision logic based on NPV advantage, technical difficulty, and cash flow constraints
- Returns both boolean and confidence score for opt-in likelihood
- Handles MAI buildings with special floor logic
- Mirrors BigQuery script logic but with corrected penalty rates

### 4. **Created Portfolio Risk Analyzer** ✅
**File:** `/src/analysis/portfolio_risk_analyzer.py`
- Comprehensive portfolio-wide risk assessment tool
- Three scenarios: All Standard, All ACO, and Hybrid/Realistic
- Uses correct penalty rates from centralized penalty calculator
- Calculates aggregate penalties by year and scenario
- Identifies high-risk buildings and retrofit opportunities
- Generates summaries by property type, size, and EPB status
- Creates visualizations for penalty projections
- Outputs JSON-ready results for API consumption

## 📊 Key Metrics & Insights

### Module Capabilities:
1. **Year Normalization**: Enables consistent time-series analysis across different base years
2. **Opt-In Logic**: Predicts building behavior based on penalty exposure and characteristics
3. **Portfolio Analysis**: Aggregates risk across entire building portfolio with scenario planning

### Integration Points:
- All modules designed to work with centralized penalty calculator
- Ready for integration with existing data loaders and compliance analyzers
- Output formats designed for API consumption and visualization

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Import Structure:
```python
from utils.penalty_calculator import EnergizeDenverPenaltyCalculator
from utils.year_normalization import YearNormalizer
from utils.opt_in_predictor import OptInPredictor
from analysis.portfolio_risk_analyzer import PortfolioRiskAnalyzer
```

### Penalty Rate Configuration:
- Standard Path: $0.15/kBtu over target
- ACO/Opt-in Path: $0.23/kBtu over target
- Extension: $0.35/kBtu over target
- Never Benchmarked: $10.00/sqft
- Reference: /docs/penalty_calculation_source_of_truth.md

## 🔍 Important Corrections from Previous Session

### Corrected Understanding:
- ACO 2028 target uses the First Interim Target value directly (not interpolated)
- Penalty rates were wrong in BigQuery scripts ($0.30/$0.70) - correct rates are $0.15/$0.23
- MAI buildings can be various property types (not just Manufacturing) - need MAI lookup
- Building targets have variable years (2024, 2025, 2026) requiring normalization for aggregate analysis

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. **Integration Testing**
- Test all new modules with real building data
- Verify opt-in logic matches BigQuery results
- Validate portfolio aggregations

### 2. **Data Pipeline Enhancement**
- Update `data_loader.py` to use new modules
- Add year normalization to time-series outputs
- Integrate opt-in predictions into building profiles

### 3. **API Development**
- Create FastAPI endpoints for portfolio risk analysis
- Add endpoints for individual building opt-in predictions
- Implement caching for expensive calculations

### 4. **Visualization Enhancement**
- Create interactive dashboards for portfolio risk
- Add drill-down capabilities from portfolio to building level
- Implement scenario comparison visualizations

### 5. **Documentation**
- Update API documentation with new endpoints
- Create user guide for portfolio risk analyzer
- Document opt-in scenario assumptions

## 🔍 Current State Assessment

### What's Working:
- Core penalty calculation logic centralized and consistent
- Modular architecture allows easy extension
- All outputs designed for API consumption
- EPB and equity considerations built into decision logic

### What Needs Attention:
- Real data testing not yet performed
- API endpoints not yet created
- Visualization components need frontend integration
- Performance optimization for large portfolios may be needed

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

1. **Opt-In Thresholds**: Set conservative thresholds to match expected building behavior
2. **Year Normalization**: Used 2024 as default base year for consistency
3. **Portfolio Scenarios**: Created three distinct scenarios for risk planning
4. **EPB Priority**: Built EPB considerations into all decision logic

## 🚨 Important Notes

- All new modules follow project conventions (relative imports, proper documentation)
- Output formats designed for both human review and machine consumption
- Penalty calculations now consistently use centralized calculator
- Ready for API endpoint development in next session

## 🎬 Ready for Next Session
The foundation modules are complete. Next session should focus on:
1. Testing with real data
2. Creating API endpoints
3. Building visualization components
4. Performance optimization

All code is properly documented and ready for integration.

## ⚠️ Outstanding Items from Previous Session
1. **Verify building_compliance_analyzer_v2.py** - Confirm it's working with correct imports, rates, and visualizations
2. **Test Portfolio Risk Analyzer** - Run with real data to verify three scenarios work correctly
3. **Consider BigQuery Integration** - Should portfolio analyzer output to BigQuery or stay local?
4. **Geographic Clustering** - Future implementation for DER opportunities

## 📝 Session Notes
- All penalty rates have been corrected throughout the codebase
- Year normalization handles variable target years (2024, 2025, 2026)
- Opt-in predictor includes MAI logic and NPV calculations
- Portfolio analyzer provides three scenarios for comprehensive risk assessment
