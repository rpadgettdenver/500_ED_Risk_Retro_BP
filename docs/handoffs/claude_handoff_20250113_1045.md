# Claude Session Handoff - January 13, 2025, 10:45 MST

## Session Summary
Successfully debugged and fixed the EUI Target Loader module. Corrected column mapping issues and clarified Building 2952 data discrepancy from previous handoff.

## Work Completed Today

### 1. Fixed EUI Target Loader Module ✅
- **Issue**: Module was looking for wrong column names in Building_EUI_Targets.csv
- **Fixed column mappings**:
  - `Baseline EUI` (was looking for "Baseline Weather Normalized Site EUI")
  - `First Interim Target EUI` (was looking for "2025 1st Interim Target Site EUI")
  - `Second Interim Target EUI` (was looking for "2027 2nd Interim Target Site EUI")
  - `Adjusted Final Target EUI` (was looking for "2030 Final Target Site EUI")
- **Result**: Module now correctly loads all building targets

### 2. Clarified Building 2952 Data ✅
- Previous handoff incorrectly stated all targets were 69.0
- **Actual Building 2952 targets**:
  - Baseline EUI: 69.0
  - First Interim (2025): 65.4
  - Second Interim (2027): 63.2
  - Final (2030): 61.0
- Building is EPB (Equity Priority Building) with target adjustment flag

### 3. Enhanced EUI Target Loader Features ✅
- Added property type and square footage to output
- Better handling of buildings with zero baseline EUI
- Added flags for target adjustment and electrification credit
- Improved logging and error messages
- Created comprehensive test script

## Current State

### Working Modules
1. **Penalty Calculator** (`src/utils/penalty_calculator.py`) ✅
   - Correct rates: Standard=$0.15, Opt-in=$0.23, Extension=$0.35
   - Handles all penalty scenarios properly

2. **EUI Target Loader** (`src/utils/eui_target_loader.py`) ✅
   - Loads targets from CSV with correct columns
   - Applies MAI logic: MAX(CSV target, 30% reduction, 52.9 floor)
   - Applies 42% cap for non-MAI buildings
   - Handles zero baseline buildings

3. **MAI Data Loader** (`src/utils/mai_data_loader.py`) ✅
   - Loads MAI designations correctly

### Files Created/Updated
- `/src/utils/eui_target_loader.py` - Fixed version with correct column names
- `/test_eui_target_loader.py` - Comprehensive test script

## Next Steps (Not Yet Started)

### Priority 1: Update Analysis Scripts
Need to update these scripts to use the centralized modules:

1. **building_compliance_analyzer_v2.py**
   - Remove hardcoded penalty rates
   - Import: `from src.utils.penalty_calculator import EnergizeDenverPenaltyCalculator`
   - Import: `from src.utils.eui_target_loader import load_building_targets`
   - Replace inline calculations with module functions

2. **integrated_tes_hp_analyzer.py**
   - Same updates as above
   - Ensure it uses centralized penalty calculations

3. **create_opt_in_decision_model.py**
   - Fix BigQuery view to use correct penalty rates
   - Standard: $0.15/kBtu (not $0.30)
   - Opt-in: $0.23/kBtu (not $0.70)

### Priority 2: Testing
- Run `test_eui_target_loader.py` to verify all targets load correctly
- Test penalty calculations with known scenarios
- Validate MAI building logic
- Check EPB building handling

## Key Information

### Correct Penalty Rates (July 2025)
- **Standard Path**: $0.15/kBtu over target
- **Alternate/Opt-in Path**: $0.23/kBtu over target
- **Extension**: $0.35/kBtu over target
- **Never Benchmarked**: $10.00/sqft

### MAI Logic
Buildings in MAITargetSummary.csv get special treatment:
- Target = MAX(CSV target, 30% reduction from baseline, 52.9 floor)
- This provides more lenient targets for Manufacturing/Agricultural/Industrial

### Building 2952 Test Case
- Building ID: 2952
- Type: Multifamily Housing
- Square Feet: 52,826
- EPB: Yes
- MAI: No
- Has Target Adjustment: Yes
- Targets decrease properly from 69.0 → 65.4 → 63.2 → 61.0

## Questions Resolved
1. ✅ Why were Building 2952's targets all showing as 69.0? - They weren't, this was incorrect in previous handoff
2. ✅ Why do some buildings have 0 baseline EUI? - Mostly Manufacturing/Industrial buildings that may not report energy
3. ✅ Correct column names in Building_EUI_Targets.csv confirmed

## Session Metrics
- Modules fixed: 1 (eui_target_loader.py)
- Test scripts created: 1
- Issues resolved: 3
- Time invested: ~1 hour

## Handoff Instructions
1. Start by running `python test_eui_target_loader.py` to verify the fixes
2. Update building_compliance_analyzer_v2.py to use the modules
3. Test with Building 2952 as the reference case
4. Check that penalty calculations use correct rates
