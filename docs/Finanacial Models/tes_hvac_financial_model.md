# Thermal Energy Storage + Heat Pump Financial Model Framework
## Building-Level Energy-as-a-Service Business Plan

**Date:** July 10, 2025  
**Prepared for:** Robert Padgett, Energize Denver Risk & Retrofit Strategy Platform  
**Purpose:** Technical/Financial Framework for DRCOG Presentation & Investor Materials

---

## Executive Summary

This framework outlines a revolutionary Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) model that leverages Thermal Energy Storage (TES) and heat pump technology to transform Denver's building decarbonization landscape. By combining federal tax incentives, state/local rebates, and innovative financing structures, this model delivers:

- **Zero to minimal** first cost for building owners
- **Cash flow neutral or positive** from day one
- **100% BPS compliance** guarantee
- **20-30% IRR** for development capital with near-zero initial investment
- **8-12% returns** for long-term investors
- **1.5-2.5 million MTCO2e** lifetime emissions reduction across portfolio

The model is designed to deploy rapidly within DRCOG's 4-year CPRG timeline while creating a replicable, scalable solution for urban decarbonization.

## 1. Business Model Architecture

### 1.1 Deal Structure Flow

```
[Building Owner] → Signs 15-20 year Energy Service Agreement
        ↓
[Developer/SPV] → Designs, installs, owns TES + Heat Pump system
        ↓
[Tax Equity] → Purchases ITC + depreciation (Year 1)
        ↓
[Rebate Stack] → Reduces net CapEx by 85-95%
        ↓
[Operations] → Monthly energy service payments begin
        ↓
[YieldCo/REIT] → Purchases stabilized cash flows (Year 2-3)
        ↓
[Developer Exit] → Retains development fee + gain on sale
```

### 1.2 Capital Stack Optimization

**Typical $3.5M System (250,000 sq ft building)**
*Base costs include 30% escalation for tariffs and current market conditions*

| Source | Amount | % of Total |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Federal ITC (30% base) | $1,050,000 | 30% |
| ITC Bonuses (energy community + domestic) | $700,000 | 20% |
| DRCOG CPRG Grant | $500,000 - $750,000 | 14-21% |
| Xcel Clean Heat Rebates | $400,000 | 11% |
| State/City Programs | $200,000 | 6% |
| Tax Equity (depreciation value) | $350,000 | 10% |
| **Total Incentives** | **$3,200,000 - $3,450,000** | **91-99%** |
| **Net Developer Capital** | **$50,000 - $300,000** | **1-9%** |

### 1.3 Cost Estimation Framework

**RSMeans Base + 30% Market Escalation:**
- Heat Pump System: $800/ton × 1.30 = $1,040/ton
- Chilled Water TES: $150/ton-hr × 1.30 = $195/ton-hr
- Hot Water TES: $50/gallon × 1.30 = $65/gallon
- Controls & Integration: 15% of equipment cost
- Installation: 35-45% of equipment cost
- Soft Costs: 20% of hard costs

- Stratified thermal storage sized to ITC maximum (284 tons cooling / 3.4 MMBtu/hr heating)
- 4-6 hour storage duration for peak management and resilience
- Advanced predictive controls with machine learning optimization

**ITC Optimization Strategy:**
- Size TES to maximum allowable under safe harbor provisions
- Include all "functionally interdependent" components:
  - Distribution piping and pumps
  - Heat exchangers

- Heating: $20-30/MMBtu delivered
- Demand Response: $50-100/kW event
- Grid Services: Revenue share model

Annual Escalation: Lesser of 3% or actual utility rate increase
Contract Term: 15-20 years with renewal options
```
