# Energize Denver EaaS Project Handoff - Phase 2 Complete

## Project Overview
Building an Energy as a Service (EaaS) platform for Energize Denver compliance that helps building owners understand penalties, identify retrofit opportunities, and connect to thermal energy networks. The platform uses Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery, Cloud Storage) as the analytics backbone and will eventually support a public-facing API/web interface.

## Current Project State (December 2024)

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Setup ✅
- **Google Cloud Project**: `energize-denver-eaas`
- **BigQuery Dataset**: `energize_denver` (us-central1)
- **Cloud Storage Bucket**: `gs://energize-denver-eaas-data/`
- **Python Environment**: `gcp_env` with Python 3.13
- **Working Directory**: `/Users/robertpadgett/Projects/01_My_Notebooks/500_ED_Risk_Retro_BP/`

### 📊 Data Loaded to BigQuery ✅
Successfully loaded all data sources:

1. **building_eui_targets** (3,177 rows)
   - Contains baseline and target EUIs for compliance
   - Includes interim (2024/2027) and final (2030) targets
   
2. **building_consumption** (21,437 rows) - NEW!
   - Loaded from Excel file with actual consumption data
   - Multiple years of data per building
   - Contains Site EUI (actual consumption)
   
3. **building_zipcode** (3,536 rows)
   - Building ID to zipcode mapping
   
4. **epb_stats** (317 rows)
   - Equity Priority Buildings with names/addresses
   
5. **geocoded_buildings** (3,130 rows)
   - Latitude/longitude for spatial analysis
   
6. **building_analysis_v2** (view)
   - Joins targets with location data
   - Calculates reduction requirements

### 🔧 Scripts Created

#### 1. Data Loading & Processing
- `/src/gcp/load_excel_consumption_data.py` ✅
  - Reads Excel file with consumption data
  - Handles mixed data types and uploads to BigQuery
  - Creates building_consumption table

- `/src/gcp/create_penalty_view.py` 🔧 (needs fix)
  - Creates penalty_analysis view
  - Combines targets with actual consumption
  - Calculates penalties and risk categories

#### 2. Analytics Modules
- `/src/analytics/cluster_analysis_bigquery.py` ✅
  - Identifies buildings within 500m for shared infrastructure
  - Scores opportunities for heat recovery (data centers + offices)
  - Prioritizes EPB involvement
  - Exports GeoJSON for visualization

#### 3. Financial Modeling
- `/src/models/financial_model_bigquery.py` ✅
  - Calculates retrofit costs by building type
  - Models ITC incentives (30-50% with bonuses)
  - Includes Clean Heat Plan rebates
  - Computes ROI and payback periods
  - Prioritizes by financial return + social impact

### 🚧 Current Issues

1. **Penalty View Creation**
   - The `address` column doesn't exist in building_consumption table
   - Need to fix the view query by removing this reference
   - Run the fixed `create_penalty_view.py` script

2. **Missing Dependencies** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   pip install pandas-gbq  # For better BigQuery performance
   pip install pyarrow    # For better data type handling
   ```

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Fix and Create Penalty View
```bash
# The script has been fixed - just run it again
python src/gcp/create_penalty_view.py
```

### 2. Run Clustering Analysis
```bash
python src/analytics/cluster_analysis_bigquery.py
```
This will:
- Create `building_clusters` view
- Identify thermal network opportunities
- Export GeoJSON to `outputs/cluster_opportunities.geojson`
- Create `cluster_opportunities_summary` table

### 3. Run Financial Model
```bash
python src/models/financial_model_bigquery.py
```
This will:
- Create `retrofit_financial_model` view
- Calculate project costs and incentives
- Generate investment scenarios
- Export `financial_summary_export` table

### 4. Create Looker Studio Dashboard
- Connect to BigQuery dataset
- Use these key views:
  - `penalty_analysis` - Building risk levels
  - `building_clusters` - DER opportunities
  - `retrofit_financial_model` - Financial metrics
- Create maps using lat/lon data
- Filter by EPB status for equity focus

## 📈 Business Model Progress

### Phase 1: Risk Analysis ✅
- Can identify high-risk buildings
- Calculate penalty exposure
- Segment by property type

### Phase 2: Penalty Calculations 🔄
- Have actual consumption data
- Need to finish penalty view
- Can calculate 2024/2030 penalties

### Phase 3: Retrofit Planning 📋
- Cost models ready
- ITC calculations implemented
- Need to connect to cluster opportunities

### Phase 4: Thermal Networks 🔮
- Clustering algorithm ready
- Heat recovery pairs identified
- Need business development outreach

## 🔑 Key Insights So Far

1. **Data Quality**
   - Have consumption data for ~21K building-years
   - Only 317 buildings have names (from EPB data)
   - Good geocoding coverage (3,130 buildings)

2. **Risk Profile**
   - Many buildings need >30% EUI reduction
   - Office and multifamily are largest segments
   - High penalty exposure creates urgency

3. **Opportunity Areas**
   - ITC can cover 40-50% of costs
   - Clustering creates economies of scale
   - EPB buildings unlock additional funding

## 💡 Technical Tips for Next Session

1. **Always activate the virtual environment first**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/robertpadgett/Projects/01_My_Notebooks/500_ED_Risk_Retro_BP/
   source gcp_env/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Check BigQuery tables if errors occur**:
   ```python
   from google.cloud import bigquery
   client = bigquery.Client(project="energize-denver-eaas")
   for table in client.list_tables("energize_denver"):
       print(table.table_id)
   ```

3. **The Excel file has multiple years per building**:
   - Filter for most recent year when needed
   - Building ID + Year creates unique key

4. **Spatial queries use ST_GEOGPOINT**:
   - Longitude first, then latitude
   - Use ST_DISTANCE for meter distances

5. **Financial calculations assume**:
   - $0.15/kBtu penalty (default path)
   - $0.23/kBtu penalty (opt-in path)
   - 30% base ITC + 10% wage + 10% location bonuses

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Google Cloud Integration Works Well**:
   - BigQuery handles geospatial queries efficiently
   - Views cascade nicely for complex analytics
   - Cost is minimal for this data size

2. **Data Challenges**:
   - Mixed data types require careful handling
   - Building names are sparse - need enrichment
   - Multiple years need aggregation strategy

3. **Business Model Validation**:
   - High penalties create real urgency
   - Clustering shows viable thermal networks
   - ITC makes projects financially attractive
