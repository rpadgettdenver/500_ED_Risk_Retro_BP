# Energize Denver Performance Penalty Summary (April 2025 Guidance)

Penalty rates depend on how many performance target years a building has, and whether it maintains compliance. These rates supersede earlier drafts that mentioned $0.30/kBtu.

## 📊 Table: Performance Penalty Rates

| Compliance Scenario                                                                     | Penalty Rate     | Assessment                                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3 Target Years (2024, 2027, 2030), failed maintenance (>5%), or new buildings           | **$0.15 / kBtu** | In target years, then **annually** if noncompliant post-2030  |
| 2 Target Years (2026/2030 or ACO: 2028/2032)                                            | **$0.23 / kBtu** | At each milestone, then **annually** if still noncompliant    |
| 1 Target Year (timeline extension to 2030 or 2032)                                      | **$0.35 / kBtu** | At final year, then **annually** if still noncompliant        |
| Late Timeline Extension (submitted **after** target year ends)                         | **+ $0.10 / kBtu** | Add-on to one of the above rates                             |
| Never Benchmarking (or only pre-2019 data like 2017/2018)                              | **$10 / sq ft**  | One-time penalty, then **annually** if still noncompliant     |

## 🔁 Maintenance Clause

If a building meets a target (e.g., in 2030), but later backslides by more than 5%, the same penalty rate applies again. The fine becomes **annual** until the building returns to compliance.

## 🧮 Fine Calculation Formula

> Penalty = (kBtu Over Target) × (Penalty Rate) × (Gross SF)  
> Example: 10 kBtu/sf over × $0.15 × 100,000 SF = **$150,000 fine**
