# 🤝 Claude Session Handoff – January 13, 2025, 16:45 MDT

## 🧠 Session Summary
Today we completed a major project cleanup and began implementing the unified EUI target loader system. This session focused on organizing the codebase, fixing import issues, and creating foundational modules for consistent penalty and target calculations.

## ✅ Work Completed

### 1. Project Structure Cleanup ✅
- **Archived 30+ outdated files** into organized directories
- Removed duplicate versions (e.g., 5 versions of export_high_value_buildings)
- Moved test scripts from src/ to appropriate locations
- Created timestamp-based archive: `archive/cleanup_[timestamp]/`
- **📝 Result:** Clean, navigable project structure with only active modules

### 2. Fixed Import Issues ✅
- Created and ran `check_imports.py` to find broken imports
- Fixed 2 import issues:
  - `run_unified_analysis_v2.py`: Updated to use building_compliance_analyzer_v2
  - `fixed_enhanced_der_clustering.py`: Removed self-import, added missing functions
- Fixed hardcoded penalty rates in `hvac_system_impact_modeler.py`
- **📝 Result:** All active modules have correct imports

### 3. Created EUI Target Loader Module 🚧
- **File**: `src/utils/eui_target_loader.py`
- Implements unified target loading logic
- Handles MAI designation checking
- Applies MAI logic: MAX(CSV target, 30% reduction, 52.9 floor)
- Applies 42% cap for non-MAI buildings
- **Status:** Created but needs debugging (see issues below)

## ⚠️ Current Issues

### 1. EUI Target Loader Data Issues
Testing revealed problems with the target data:
- **Building 2952**: All targets showing as 69.0 (baseline = targets)
- **MAI Building 1122**: Baseline EUI is 0.0
- **Missing building names** in the output

**Likely causes**:
- Wrong column names in Building_EUI_Targets.csv
- Data quality issues in source files
- Need to verify column mappings

### 2. Scripts Still Needing Updates
These scripts need to be updated to use the new modules:
- `building_compliance_analyzer_v2.py` - Still has hardcoded penalties
- `integrated_tes_hp_analyzer.py` - Needs penalty calculator integration
- `create_opt_in_decision_model.py` - BigQuery view needs correct rates

### Key Active Modules
1. **Configuration**: `src/config/project_config.py`
2. **Penalties**: `src/utils/penalty_calculator.py` ✅
3. **Targets**: `src/utils/eui_target_loader.py` 🚧
4. **MAI Data**: `src/utils/mai_data_loader.py` ✅
5. **Main Runner**: `run_unified_analysis_v2.py`
6. **Report Generator**: `generate_developer_returns_report.py`

## ⏭️ Next Steps

### Priority 1: Debug EUI Target Loader
1. Examine Building_EUI_Targets.csv column structure
2. Verify correct column names for:
   - Baseline EUI
   - Interim targets
   - Final targets
3. Test with known good building data
4. Add better error handling for missing data

### Priority 2: Complete Script Updates
1. Update `building_compliance_analyzer_v2.py`:
   ```python
   from src.utils.penalty_calculator import EnergizeDenverPenaltyCalculator
   from src.utils.eui_target_loader import load_building_targets
   ```
2. Update `integrated_tes_hp_analyzer.py` similarly

3. Create comprehensive test suite

### Priority 3: Validate Calculations
1. Test Building 2952 with corrected data
2. Verify MAI logic with real MAI buildings
3. Compare results with technical guidance
4. Document any discrepancies

## 💰 Penalty Reference Rates (as of July 2025)
| Path                      | Rate                 |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Standard Path             | $0.15/kBtu           |
| Alternate/Opt-in Path     | $0.23/kBtu           |
| Extension                 | $0.35/kBtu           |
| Never Benchmarked         | $10.00/sqft          |

### MAI Logic
- Buildings in MAITargetSummary.csv get special treatment
- Target = MAX(CSV target, 30% reduction, 52.9 floor)
- Not limited to Manufacturing/Industrial property types

### Building 2952 (Test Case)
- EPB building (Equity Priority)
- NOT MAI
- Should have different interim and final targets
- Current data showing all targets = 69.0 is incorrect

## 🧩 Questions / Open Investigations

1. Why are Building 2952's targets all the same?
2. Why do some buildings have 0 baseline EUI?
3. Are we reading the correct columns from Building_EUI_Targets.csv?
4. Do we need to merge data from multiple sources for complete targets?

## 📊 Session Metrics
- Files archived: 30+
- Import issues fixed: 3
- New modules created: 1 (eui_target_loader.py)
- Modules updated: 2
- Time invested: ~3 hours

## 🤖 Handoff Instructions
1. Start by debugging the EUI target loader data issues
2. Check Building_EUI_Targets.csv structure
3. Complete the script updates once target loader is working
4. Run full test suite with Building 2952
